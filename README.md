##React Expense Tracker
Introducing a straightforward React Expense Tracker app that enables users to add and manage their expenses efficiently and systematically. This app is built using the React framework, which makes use of components and React hooks, such as useState, for efficient state management and modular code.

Featuring an intuitive interface, users can enter the expense category, description, date, and amount, followed by clicking the "Add a new expense" button to incorporate it into the table.
Each row includes a dedicated "delete" button, allowing for the selective removal of any row as needed.
The table presents all recorded expenses in a tidy and well-organized layout, offering users a convenient way to monitor their spending.

After entering the necessary information, simply click the "Add a New Expense" button, and the placeholder will be replaced with a new row containing the user's input, as illustrated below.

This app marks my fourth JavaScript project to date, with a focus on React.

React components: The app is built using a modular structure, consisting of various functional components for handling different aspects of the application, such as input fields, buttons, and the expense table. Each component is reusable and can be easily integrated into the app to improve maintainability and readability.

React hooks: The useState hook is employed for efficient state management within functional components. By using useState, the app can easily track the state of user inputs, expenses, and table updates. This makes it easier to manage state changes and trigger updates in response to user actions.

CSS styling: The app's visual design is managed by CSS, encompassing styles for layout, colors, and fonts. The table container and other components feature relevant classes that define their display, alignment, background color, width, and positioning.

React functionality: The app leverages React to manage user interactions, such as adding expenses to the table and processing input data. It employs the virtual DOM to create, update, and display expense information based on user input.

In addition to React and CSS, this Expense Tracker app also utilizes the Bootstrap framework for a responsive and modern design. Bootstrap's pre-built components and grid system make it easy to create a consistent and aesthetically pleasing layout across various devices. By integrating Bootstrap, the app ensures a seamless user experience with enhanced UI components, ensuring optimal functionality and a polished appearance.

The app's core functionality revolves around obtaining user inputs, storing them in state using useState, and dynamically generating table rows to showcase the added expenses in a well-ordered manner. The code comprises a combination of state hooks and functions that handle data extraction, table updates, and other crucial tasks.
